Code Tree for ImageJ Migration to Android
=========================================

PLEASE NOTE:

1.  THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT READY FOR GENERAL USE YET.  AN ANNOUNCEMENT
    WILL BE MADE LATER (IN THIS README) FILE WHEN THE REPOSITORY IS
    READY.

2.  The ImageJDroid name may not be permanent.  If the Android ImageJ
    version, when completed, can be easily integrated into ImageJ and
    seamlessly fired up as an Anroid app, the ImageJDroid name will be
    dropped or kept only for development purposes.
